## My process
I watched Brad (Traversy Media) create his site and followed along. This was a practice site to hone in on Materialize CSS.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Materialize CSS
- Font Awesome (https://use.fontawesome.com/releases/v5.0.13/css/all.css)
- Google Icon Fonts (https://fonts.googleapis.com/icon?family=Material+Icons)
- jQuery(https://code.jquery.com/jquery-3.3.1.min.js)

### What I learned

I've been trying to learn the CSS framework Materialize so creating a site with it helped a lot. Also, Brad's way of creating markup was really useful to learn from. I'll probably be using his style of markup from this point on.

## Acknowledgments

Would love to thank Brad (Traversy Media) for putting out such amazing content for everyboody to learn from.
